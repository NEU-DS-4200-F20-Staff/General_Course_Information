# GitHub Classroom instructions

Below are general instructions and policies that apply to each of your GitHub Classroom assignments for the course:

- [GitHub Classroom instructions](#github-classroom-instructions)
  - [Accepting an assignment](#accepting-an-assignment)
  - [Assignment instructions](#assignment-instructions)
  - [Invitation links vs. forking](#invitation-links-vs-forking)
  - [Grading](#grading)

## Accepting an assignment

1. Click the **GitHub Classroom link** on the Canvas assignment to set up a git repository for you to work in.

    * The first time you accept an assignment for the course, you will need to connect your GitHub account with our roster imported from Canvas. If you do not have a GitHub account yet, you will need to [create one](https://github.com/join) before connecting it.

    * Your interface will look something like [this](https://github.blog/2020-03-18-set-up-your-digital-classroom-with-github-classroom/#what-your-students-see).

1. Accept the Assignment.

1. Wait for it to create a repository.

1. Click on the link to where the Assignment repository has been created.

## Assignment instructions

1. Follow the instructions included in the `README.md` file at the root of your repository.
   
   * GitHub nicely displays this for you when you go to the repository online. Many text editors will also display previews for you. E.g., [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) has a nice [Markdown preview and extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown).

   * **You are expected to follow the instructions exactly.** If you don't, you may miss out on the associated learning targets. Accepting assignments in varied forms also adds grading challenges and reduces the time we have for providing higher-level feedback on content to you and to other students. Permitting variances sets unrealistic expectations for you for future courses and for the real world where following seemingly pointless instructions often does in fact matter.

## Invitation links vs. forking

The [GitHub Classroom](classroom.github.com/) invitation link we provide is creating a copy of a [template repo](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-template-repository) we created that gives you a starting place.

**Do not just fork this repo or use it as a template directly — you will get a 0 on the assignment!** Instead, use the GitHub Classroom invitation link.

Using the invitation link and doing/submitting your work in the GitHub Classroom repo makes it easier for us to troubleshoot your work, harder for you to break configuration, supports academic integrity assessments including across instances of the course, provides a better record of what you did & when, and facilitates faster and better grading.

## Grading

1. Please see the rubric on the Canvas assignment ([Canvas documentation](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-view-the-rubric-for-my-assignment/ta-p/275)).
