# D3 tips, tricks, and troubleshooting

Below are some additional info that can help with your D3 assignments:

## Resources

**There are different versions of D3**, so make sure that the tutorials that you are using are up-to-date and use the same version we are (version 6). 

* [D3 Homepage](https://d3js.org)
* [D3 API Documentation](https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/API.md)
* [D3 v6 examples on Observable](https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery). Note that it is hard to copy whole examples from Observable.
* [Breaking changes in D3v6](https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/CHANGES.md#user-content-breaking-changes)
* [D3 Wiki Gallery](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Gallery)
* [D3 Wiki Tutorials](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Tutorials)
* [Tons of examples on bl.ocks.org](https://bl.ocks.org/). It is much easier to duplicate whole examples vs. Observable.
* [D3 Tips and Tricks **v3.x (Warning: old version of D3)**](https://leanpub.com/D3-Tips-and-Tricks/read)

## Function/method chaining

D3, and this assignment, use [function chaining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_chaining) to apply several changes to the same visualization.

You don't have to use chaining.
E.g., instead of this:

```js
d3.select('body')
  .append('p')
    .text('Hello, world!');
```

you can write:

```js
let body = d3.select('body');
let p = body.append('p');
p.text('Hello, world!');
```

## JS statements: `let` vs. `var` vs. `const`

To make our code more modular, reusable, and error-free we should limit variable scope to the relevant parts of the code.
In part, we do this by using [`let` statements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let) instead of [`var`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var) by default so as to not set global variables.
We can also use [`const`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const) to create read-only references.

## ES6 Arrow functions `=>`

We can use [ES6 Arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions) to simplify our code.
E.g., instead of writing `function(d){ return d.name; }` we write `d => d.name` or `d => { return d.name; }`. We would use the latter version with surrounding `{...}` when we need multiple lines of code vs. just a simple expression.

Note that using the arrow functions we are not able to use `d3.select(this)` like you see in many esp. older D3 examples. Instead, in D3v6 you can now use `d3.select(event.currentTarget)`.
See [this post](https://medium.com/@yonester/on-d3-and-arrow-functions-b6559c1cebb8) for an older discussion and [the D3v6 migration guide](https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3v6-migration-guide#events) for  this new approach.
